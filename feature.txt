3. refactor the following route

4. write this method, use hints in comments 
 to apply it, it's pretty common and you will need
 to do some manipulation with JSON data

5. add CRUD (get, post, delete, put) commands for the services.
 we will expand our application and add addition feature,
 users will have different services (pizza delivery, bear delivery, etc)
 you will need to create this functionality
 so, I want to see CRUD for this data
 {
   id - service id (just like we did for user)
   userId - each service will have user id for mapping
   title - service`s title
   description - service`s description
   time - when service should be done
 }
 you need to create new JSON file services.json for this task, apply validation, error handling, etc
 just like we did in users.js

6. update readme



hints:
 - put validation files into /validation
 - create new folder for errors
